1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
    - Polish Bankrupt Data
3. Data processing
	- pandas dataframe
	- Dropping unwanted column
	- Keras Preprocessing

4. Visualization using seaborn & matplotlib
5. Label Encoding using LabelEncoder
6. Feature Selection
	- With Feature Selection using SelectMutual
	- With All Feature
8. Splitting the data into train and test
9. Building the model

	- Opt Based on GA

		- SVM
		- XGB
		- ANN
		- Hybrid Model XGB + ANN
		- Voting Classifier (Bagging Classifier with RF + DT)

	- Opt Based on PSO

		- SVM
		- XGB
		- ANN
		- Hybrid Model XGB + ANN
		- Voting Classifier (Bagging Classifier with RF + DT)

10. Training the model
11. Dumping the best model 



Flask Framework
----------------
 
12. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
13. Importing the packages
14. User gives input as Feature Values 
15. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
16. Trained model is used for prediction
17. Final outcome is displayed through frontend



Extension
----------

In the base paper the author mentioned to use Bankrupt Prediction Data for analysis and predicting whether the bank is crupt or not
using hybrid model of XGB + ANN and compared with other models, and proposed model got 98% of accuracy,
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction.
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as Voting Classifier, 
from which voting classifier got 100% of accuracy,
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
